<span class="underline">Net Art Anatomy</span> is a Rhizome workshop which I fascilitated on October 26th at [MozFest 2014](http://2014.mozillafestival.org/){:target="_blank"} in London.

 _Union jack_ made by participant BÃ©atrice Lajous uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/){:target="_blank"}, a popular web interface framework, as raw material for a browser-based work in the tradition of Alexi Shulgin's [Form Art](http://www.c3.hu/collection/form/){:target="_blank"}.

We began by looking together at examples of internet art by seminal artists--from JODI, recent winners of the [Prix Net Art prize](http://prixnetart.org/){:target="_blank"}, to [@Horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks){:target="_blank"} (if a phenomenon may be considered an artist).

The workshop imbues a deep appreciation for the practices, both technical and conceptual/critical, used in making internet art, and an understanding of the life of media technologies outside their prescribed historical or functional roles.

<br><span class="underline">Net Art Anatomy</span> may be coming to a high school classroom near you. [New Hive](http://newhive.com/){:target="_blank"}, a canvas for web-native expression (see [Harry Burke's piece](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2014/aug/26/new-hive/){:target="_blank"} on Rhizome), is a potential teaching aid. For more on the workshop, check out the [instructions for projects](http://labs.rhizome.org/net-art-anatomy){:target="_blank"} and MozFest's [Art Track Tumblr](http://mozfestartoftheweb.tumblr.com/){:target="_blank"}. A good sense of the conference ethos can be gleamed from [these images on Flickr](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/neon_lobster/sets/72157648629817189/){:target="_blank"}--some of which feature my head.
