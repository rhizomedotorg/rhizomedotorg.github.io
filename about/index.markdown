Flexibility and experimentation are paramount at [Rhizome](http://rhizome.org/about/). For an organization of small size (IRL that is, weâ€™re huge where it counts\[online\]), we do a lot of development in-house. Rhizome Labs was created to share knowledge and tactics, and to provide a resource for technologists working within arts and cultural institutions. At Rhizome we leverage open source tech and host our projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/rhizomedotorg/). Stay tuned.

Rhizome is a nonprofit deeply rooted in artistic practices that engage with technology. Since 1996, our website has provided a platform for the exhibition of artworks. Our offices are located within the New Museum of Contemporary Art in NYC.
