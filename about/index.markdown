Flexibility and experimentation are paramount at Rhizome. For an organization of small size (IRL that is, weâ€™re huge where it counts [online]), we do a lot of in-house software development. Our engineers created this blog, Rhizome Labs, to share knowledge and tactics, and to provide a resource for technologists working within arts & cultural institutions. At Rhizome we leverage open source tech and host our projects on GitHub. Stay tuned.

Rhizome is a nonprofit deeply rooted in artistic practices that engage with technology. Since 1996, our website has provided a platform for [blah blah blah]. Our offices are located within the New Museum of Contemporary Art in NYC.
